/*
Write a C program that creates a simple calculator.

Your calculator should be capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two user-inputted numbers.
To accomplish this, utilize the switch-case control structure to determine the chosen
operation based on the user input. Your code should include proper user prompts, input
validation, and clear output displaying both the calculation and error messages when
applicable. 
Additionally, aim to create a user-friendly and robust calculator program that
handles various scenarios gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.
